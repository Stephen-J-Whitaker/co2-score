# **CO2 Score**
['CO2 score'](https://co2-score.herokuapp.com/) is a piece of software that provides the user with a score that presents the amount of carbon dioxide that their current lifestyle contributes to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and their equivalents contribute to global warming and the risk of irreparable damage to our ecosystem. It is a topic that is close to the hearts of many.
Based on the questions provided on wikiHOW.com, the questionnaire caters for those with a passing interest and those who wish to optimise their lifestyle and monitor their performance improvement by repeating the questionnaire on different dates and comparing their current and previous scores. The questions provide useful information that can help to guide the user in improving their carbon score by altering their lifestyle should they wish to do so.
