# **CO2 Score**
['CO2 score'](https://co2-score.herokuapp.com/) is a piece of software that provides the user with a score that presents the amount of carbon dioxide that their current lifestyle contributes to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and their equivalents contribute to global warming and the risk of irreparable damage to our ecosystem. It is a topic that is close to the hearts of many.
Based on the questions provided on wikiHOW.com, the questionnaire caters for those with a passing interest and those who wish to optimise their lifestyle and monitor their performance improvement by repeating the questionnaire on different dates and comparing their current and previous scores. The questions provide useful information that can help to guide the user in improving their carbon score by altering their lifestyle should they wish to do so.

## **1. Project Initiation**
- User stories
  
  User stories were ascertained for the game along with the features required to satisfy the user stories. A feature list was developed that covered all of the user stories requirements and it was ensured that there was no duplicated feature functionality going into development.

## **2. Questionnaire Tool Development**
  - ### **Tool Functionality Development**

    - ### Interface Mockups
      The tool is implemented using the Python ‘backend’ language and is made available on the internet in a desktop browser via a mock terminal coded by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). As such the requirement for user interface design was minimal especially in terms of the web page itself. The web page was developed in advance by Code Institute but could be custom styled prior to deployment.

  - ### **'CO2 Score' Style Development**

       Styling of the HTML, (HTML supplied by Code Institute), was possible but was to remain minimal so as not to distract from the terminal itself and the software output presented within it which was to be the focus of the users’ attention. 

    - **Interface Layout**

      For aesthetics, the mock terminal is centred within the HTML page in which it is presented and, again for aesthetics, the ‘run program’ button is horizontally centred above the mock terminal. 

      The CLI itself is hardcoded to 80 character cell columns and 24 character cell rows which was a constraint of the project.

      Within the CLI, images are centred for aesthetics and text is printed to the command line interface such that it is one character in from the edge for readability. Any requests to press enter to continue are at the bottom of the terminal.

    - **Typography**

      The title for the CO2 Score tool was generated by [Ascii Art Generator]( https://patorjk.com/software/taag/) and copied into the software. 

      The font and size of all other text within the software output is dictated by and hardcoded into the software that generates the mock terminal and cannot be altered.

    - **Colour Scheme**

      The theme of the software being related to Earth’s atmosphere, a harmonious colour scheme inspired by the colours commonly used to depict Earth from space were chosen. Images were designed in blues and greens and the interface and text were styled blue and white respectively. 
      The exception to this was the result page score bar which is green if the total score is less than or equal to the recommended level of 60 and red if it is above 60.
      
      The colour scheme of the CLI is restricted to those that the mock terminal can generate, that can be accessed by ANSI Escape characters and made available through the [Colorama Python library]( https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

    - **Images and Graphics**

      Images and graphics possible within the CLI are extremely rudimentary. 

      2 character cells next to each other horizontally take up a square region of the CLI therefore, with the CLI being 80 characters across by 24 down, bitmaps of 40 by 24 pixels can be transferred to the CLI by colouring full cell ASCII characters appropriately and printing them to the screen using the bitmap as a template.

      A 40 x 24 pixel image of Earth was produced in a [Corel Paint](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/pages/photo-editing/) to be used as an image to be shown on startup.

      ![Earth shown on startup](docs/images/readme-earth-image.jpg)

      The same principle of colours and printing full cell ascii characters to the screen was used to produce bar charts to depict the proportion that the users score represents compared to the maximum possible score.

    - **User Feedback**

      User feedback is by means of the requested action being seen to have taken place. For example, the user requesting that they be taken to the main menu followed by them seeing that they have been returned to the main menu. 

      On other occasions, for example to confirm that their data has been deleted from the system, there will be a printed message that confirms the requested action has been taken place.
